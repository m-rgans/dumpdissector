== DUMP DISSECTOR ==

Tool for interpreting dumps generated by the ASSIST assembler for certain
IBM mainframes.

Usage:
  ddi [options] [command] [arguments...]

Commands:
  psw [First 8 bytes of psw] [Second 8 bytes of psw]
      - Interprets the input as a program status word, and outputs info from it

Building:
  simply running 'make' will compile ddi. ddi can be copied into your bin folder
  for easy access from the command line.

  If anyone wants to set up a build for windows I'll accept pulls for it,
  but I have no interest atm in making it myself.

Legal stuff:
